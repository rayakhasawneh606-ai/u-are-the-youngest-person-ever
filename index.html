      <p>
mg babygirl happy one year 😛😛😛 one year with you is actually INSAAANNNEEE to me because if you told me a year ago that i’d be this close with you, i literally would’ve laughed and said you were joking. i never expected us to become friends at all. when i really think about it you’re not just someone in my life, you’re part of it in ways i didn’t even notice happening. you saw me in states i hate being seen in like insecure, emotional or quiet, defensive, overthinking, etc. and instead ghosting me or something, you stayed and tried to help even when you were busy or it wasn’t easy for you, and that mattered more to me than you probably realize. this year taught me that soulmates aren’t always romantic, they can be platonic and honestly i didn’t believe that until i met you.
<br><br>
there were times where everything felt heavy, where i couldn’t explain myself properly, where i was scared of being too much or saying the wrong thing and you still listened, still tried to understand instead of brushing it off. being friends with you showed me how rare it is to feel emotionally safe with someone, to know i can say what i feel without it being used against me later. you became the person i naturally lean toward, not because i need you to fix things but because having you there makes things feel manageable. you’re genuinely the only reasons i’m not going insane right now 😭😭😭😭. there were moments where i felt lost and unsure of myself and just you being there made it easier to breathe. one year with you isn’t meaningful because of the time, it’s meaningful because of the depth and the trust we built. you’re not just someone i love when things are easy, you’re someone i trust when things are hard and that’s why this year matters to me more than anything 💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗💗
<br><br>
i don’t say “i love you” easily, and i definitely don’t say it lightly, and honestly i don’t even say it to anyone but with you it feels right. i love you for who you are, not just for how you show up for me when i need you but also for your heart, your intentions, the way you care even when you don’t have to and no one’s asking you to. i love how you understand me without explaining perfectly, how you notice when something’s off even when i’m pretending i’m fine, and how you never make me feel stupid, dramatic, or annoying for feeling the way i do.
<br><br>
i love that you make me feel seen without trying, that you always make me laugh even when i’m in the worst mood, and that you look out for me in a way that feels natural and not forced. you’re someone i will always respect and value, someone i trust, someone i want in my life for a long time, no matter what changes around us. i choose you as my person, as my safe place, as someone i keep close to my heart even from a distance. i’ll always choose you to be my best friend in every universe, in every life, because you’re not just someone i care about, you’re someone i genuinely love and never want to lose.
<br><br>
i love you for the comfort you give without even trying, for the way your presence alone can calm me down and make things feel less heavy, even from miles away. i love you so much that no matter where life takes us or how much time passes, you’ll always be someone i hold close someone i choose, and someone im endlessly grateful to have in my life and ALSOOOO my top 1 best friend no matter what. (you’re my best friend i’ll love you forever - the nbhd) 🩶🩶🩶🩶🩶🩶🩶
<br><br>
thank you for being you, for never making me feel like i had to earn your care or attention. thank you for listening to me even when i didn’t know how to explain myself properly, for being patient with me when im a slow bih, and for never making me feel like i was too much. thank you for checking on me. thank you for making me feel safe, for making me laugh when i needed it the most, and for being someone i can rely on without fear. i’m so grateful for you and for our friendship, and for everything you bring into my life, and i hope you always know how much i appreciate you, value you, and thank you for simply being you. i love you soooo much my baby girl 🙁🙁🙁🙁💗💗💗💗💗
